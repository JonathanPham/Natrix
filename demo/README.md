# Natrix Demo

This folder contains a complete example of how to user Natrix.

It demonstrates how to:
* use the velocity field to animate a simple smooth particles area.
* use different resolutions for the velocity field.
* use [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) to create a simple GUI for controlling the simulation.
* support HiDPI screens.
* add velocities and obstacles to the simulation
